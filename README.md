# Mini-Front-end-Projects

This is a collection of multiple 
front-end projects made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 1. Rock Paper Scissors
A basic rock paper scissors game.

Shows the result of the move and total Wins, Losses and Ties.

It uses a local storage to store the score, which can be reset using the reset score button.

### 1.1 Added an auto play system which picks user and computer moves on its own, and keeps updating the score.
  It uses the setInterval function which plays the game once every second, and can be stopped by     clicking the button again (uses a simple lock mechanism).

## 2. ToDo List
A Simple Todo-List.

Takes the input of the task and the due date.

Additional feature to delete the task from the list.

1. Saving the data
2. Creating the html
3. Making it interactive
